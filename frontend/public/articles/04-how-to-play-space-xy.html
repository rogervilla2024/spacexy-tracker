            <p>Before proceeding, it's important to understand that Space XY is a gambling game with a house edge. This guide explains game mechanics but does not provide any method to overcome the mathematical advantage held by the casino. Always gamble responsibly and within your means.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="game-overview">
            <h2>Game Overview</h2>
            <p>Space XY is a crash-style casino game featuring a space exploration theme. The core concept is simple: a rocket launches and a multiplier increases until the rocket "crashes" at a random point. Players must cash out before the crash to win.</p>

            <h3>Key Game Features</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Theme:</strong> Space/rocket with cosmic visuals</li>
                <li><strong>RTP:</strong> 97% (Return to Player)</li>
                <li><strong>House Edge:</strong> 3%</li>
                <li><strong>Maximum Multiplier:</strong> 10,000x</li>
                <li><strong>Unique Feature:</strong> X and Y axis multiplier display</li>
                <li><strong>Provider:</strong> BGaming</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>The Basic Premise</h3>
            <p>In each round of Space XY:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Players place bets before the round starts</li>
                <li>A rocket launches into space</li>
                <li>A multiplier increases as the rocket ascends</li>
                <li>Players must click "Cash Out" before the rocket crashes</li>
                <li>If you cash out in time, you win your bet multiplied by the cash-out value</li>
                <li>If the rocket crashes before you cash out, you lose your bet</li>
            </ol>
        </section>

        <section id="interface">
            <h2>Understanding the Interface</h2>
            <p>The Space XY interface is designed for clarity and ease of use. Here's what you'll see on screen:</p>

            <h3>Main Game Area</h3>
            <p>The central portion of the screen displays the rocket and its journey through space. The X and Y coordinates are shown as the rocket moves, creating a unique visual representation of the multiplier.</p>

            <h3>Multiplier Display</h3>
            <p>The current multiplier is prominently displayed, typically in the center of the screen. This number increases as the rocket travels and shows the value you would receive if you cash out at that moment.</p>

            <h3>Betting Panel</h3>
            <p>Usually located at the bottom of the screen, the betting panel includes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Bet amount input field</li>
                <li>Quick-bet buttons (preset amounts)</li>
                <li>Bet/Cash Out button</li>
                <li>Auto cash-out setting</li>
                <li>Balance display</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>History Panel</h3>
            <p>A history section shows recent crash points, allowing players to see the results of previous rounds. Remember: past results do not predict future outcomes.</p>

            <h3>Player Activity</h3>
            <p>Many versions of Space XY show other players' bets and cash-outs in real-time, creating a social element to the game.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="step-by-step">
            <h2>Step-by-Step Guide to Playing</h2>

            <h3>Step 1: Find Space XY at a Licensed Casino</h3>
            <p>Space XY is available at various online casinos that offer BGaming products. Ensure you choose a licensed, reputable operator. Create an account and make a deposit if you haven't already.</p>

            <h3>Step 2: Navigate to the Game</h3>
            <p>Find Space XY in the casino's game library. It may be listed under "Crash Games," "Instant Games," or "BGaming" categories.</p>

            <h3>Step 3: Set Your Bet Amount</h3>
            <p>During the betting phase (usually indicated by a countdown timer):</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Enter your desired bet amount in the bet field</li>
                <li>Use quick-bet buttons if available for faster selection</li>
                <li>Verify your bet amount before confirming</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Step 4: Place Your Bet</h3>
            <p>Click the "Bet" button to confirm your wager. Your bet will be locked in for the upcoming round. Some games allow you to place multiple bets per round.</p>

            <h3>Step 5: Watch the Launch</h3>
            <p>Once the betting phase ends, the rocket launches. The multiplier begins at 1.00x and starts climbing. The rocket travels through space, with its position tracked on the X and Y axes.</p>

            <h3>Step 6: Decide When to Cash Out</h3>
            <p>This is the critical decision point. As the multiplier increases, you must decide when to click "Cash Out" to secure your winnings. The longer you wait, the higher the potential payout - but also the higher the risk of losing everything if the rocket crashes.</p>

            <h3>Step 7: Cash Out or Crash</h3>
            <p>Two outcomes are possible:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Cash Out Success:</strong> You click Cash Out before the crash. You win your bet multiplied by the cash-out multiplier.</li>
                <li><strong>Crash:</strong> The rocket crashes before you cash out. You lose your entire bet for that round.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Step 8: Prepare for the Next Round</h3>
            <p>After each round ends, a new betting phase begins. Review your results, adjust your bet if desired, and decide whether to continue playing.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="betting-options">
            <h2>Betting Options</h2>

            <h3>Bet Sizing</h3>
            <p>Space XY typically offers a wide range of bet sizes to accommodate different budgets. The minimum and maximum bets vary by casino, but common ranges are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Minimum Bet:</strong> Usually $0.10 to $1.00</li>
                <li><strong>Maximum Bet:</strong> Can range from $100 to $1,000+</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Always check the specific limits at your chosen casino.</p>

            <h3>Multiple Bets</h3>
            <p>Space XY typically allows players to place multiple bets in a single round (usually two). This enables strategies where:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>One bet targets a low, "safe" multiplier</li>
                <li>Another bet aims for higher multipliers</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Each bet operates independently within the same round.</p>

            <h3>Bet Adjustment</h3>
            <p>Between rounds, you can:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Manually enter a new bet amount</li>
                <li>Use +/- buttons to adjust incrementally</li>
                <li>Use preset buttons for common amounts</li>
                <li>Use "double" or "half" buttons if available</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section id="cash-out">
            <h2>Cash-Out Mechanics</h2>

            <h3>Manual Cash-Out</h3>
            <p>The most common method is manual cash-out, where you click the "Cash Out" button at your chosen moment. Your payout is calculated as:</p>
            <p style="background-color: #f2f2f2; padding: 15px; font-family: monospace; text-align: center;">
                <strong>Payout = Bet Amount x Cash-Out Multiplier</strong>
            </p>

            <h4>Example Payouts</h4>
            <table style="width: 100%; border-collapse: collapse; margin: 20px 0;">
                <tr style="background-color: #f2f2f2;">
                    <th style="padding: 12px; text-align: left; border: 1px solid #ddd;">Bet Amount</th>

                    <th style="padding: 12px; text-align: left; border: 1px solid #ddd;">Profit</th>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td style="padding: 12px; border: 1px solid #ddd;">$10</td>

                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td style="padding: 12px; border: 1px solid #ddd;">$10</td>
                    <td style="padding: 12px; border: 1px solid #ddd;">2.00x</td>

                </tr>
                <tr>

                    <td style="padding: 12px; border: 1px solid #ddd;">$50.00</td>
                    <td style="padding: 12px; border: 1px solid #ddd;">$40.00</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td style="padding: 12px; border: 1px solid #ddd;">$10</td>
                    <td style="padding: 12px; border: 1px solid #ddd;">10.00x</td>
                    <td style="padding: 12px; border: 1px solid #ddd;">$100.00</td>
                    <td style="padding: 12px; border: 1px solid #ddd;">$90.00</td>
                </tr>
            </table>

            <h3>Cash-Out Timing</h3>
            <p>The cash-out button typically becomes active as soon as the multiplier starts climbing (above 1.00x). There may be a brief moment of latency between clicking and the action registering, so don't cut it too close to your desired multiplier.</p>

            <p>This feature allows you to set a target multiplier before the round begins. If the game reaches that multiplier, you automatically cash out without needing to click manually.</p>

            <h4>How to Use Auto Cash-Out</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Look for the "Auto Cash Out" or "Auto" field in the betting panel</li>
                <li>Enter your target multiplier (e.g., 2.00x)</li>
                <li>Place your bet as normal</li>
                <li>If the round reaches 2.00x, you automatically cash out</li>
                <li>If the round crashes before 2.00x, you lose your bet</li>
            </ol>

            <h4>Benefits of Auto Cash-Out</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Removes emotional decision-making</li>
                <li>Ensures consistent targeting of specific multipliers</li>
                <li>Prevents missing cash-out due to slow reactions</li>
                <li>Useful when connection stability is a concern</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Auto-Bet</h3>
            <p>Some versions of Space XY include auto-bet functionality, which automatically places bets each round based on your settings. This can include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Fixed bet amount</li>
                <li>Stop-loss limits (stop after losing X amount)</li>
                <li>Win limits (stop after winning X amount)</li>
                <li>Number of rounds to auto-bet</li>
            </ul>

            <div style="background-color: #fff3cd; border: 1px solid #ffc107; padding: 15px; margin: 20px 0; border-radius: 5px;">
                <strong>Caution:</strong> Auto-bet features can lead to rapid losses. If using auto-bet, always set strict loss limits and monitor your session closely. Never leave auto-bet running unattended.

            <h2>Understanding the X/Y Axis</h2>
            <p>Space XY's unique feature is its dual-axis multiplier display. Here's how it works:</p>

            <h3>What the Axes Represent</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>X-Axis (Horizontal):</strong> Represents horizontal distance traveled by the rocket</li>
                <li><strong>Y-Axis (Vertical):</strong> Represents altitude/vertical distance traveled</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>How They Create the Multiplier</h3>
            <p>As the rocket travels through space, its position is tracked on both axes. The combination of X and Y coordinates determines the displayed multiplier. This creates a more visually engaging experience than a simple linear multiplier.</p>

            <h3>Visual Experience</h3>
            <p>The rocket's path through the X/Y coordinate system creates a dynamic visual display. You'll see the rocket moving across the screen while both coordinate values increase, ultimately producing the multiplier value you can cash out at.</p>

            <h3>Does the X/Y System Change the Game?</h3>
            <p>The X/Y display is primarily a visual innovation. The underlying mathematics - the crash point distribution and RTP - work the same way as other crash games. The dual-axis display doesn't change your odds or provide any strategic advantage; it's an aesthetic choice that makes the game more visually interesting.</p>

            <h2>Round Phases Explained</h2>
            <p>Understanding the different phases of each round helps you play more effectively.</p>

            <h2>Essential Tips for Beginners</h2>

            <h3>1. Start with Demo Mode</h3>
            <p>If available, play the demo version of Space XY first. This lets you understand the mechanics without risking real money.</p>

            <h3>2. Begin with Small Bets</h3>
            <p>While learning, use the minimum bet amount. This allows you to play more rounds and gain experience while minimizing potential losses.</p>

            <h3>3. Understand the Odds</h3>
            <p>Remember that approximately 50% of rounds crash below 2.00x. Expecting consistent high multipliers will lead to disappointment and losses.</p>

            <h3>4. Use Auto Cash-Out</h3>
            <p>When starting out, auto cash-out can help you stick to a plan rather than getting caught up in the excitement and waiting too long.</p>

            <h3>5. Set Limits Before Playing</h3>
            <p>Decide in advance:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Maximum amount you're willing to lose</li>
                <li>Time limit for your session</li>
                <li>Win goal where you'll stop (optional)</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>6. Don't Chase Losses</h3>
            <p>If you lose several rounds, don't increase bets trying to recover quickly. This often leads to larger losses.</p>

            <h3>7. Take Breaks</h3>
            <p>Crash games move fast. Take regular breaks to maintain perspective and avoid impulsive decisions.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="common-mistakes">
            <h2>Common Mistakes to Avoid</h2>

            <h3>Mistake 1: Waiting for "Due" High Multipliers</h3>
            <p>After several low crashes, players often believe a high multiplier is "due." This is the gambler's fallacy. Each round is independent.</p>

            <h3>Mistake 2: Increasing Bets After Losses</h3>
            <p>Doubling bets to recover losses (Martingale strategy) doesn't work against the house edge and can quickly deplete your bankroll.</p>

            <h3>Mistake 3: Not Setting Auto Cash-Out</h3>
            <p>Relying solely on manual cash-out can lead to missing your target due to hesitation, greed, or technical issues.</p>

            <h3>Mistake 4: Playing Beyond Your Limits</h3>
            <p>The fast pace of crash games makes it easy to exceed planned spending. Set strict limits and stick to them.</p>

            <h3>Mistake 5: Ignoring the House Edge</h3>
            <p>With a 3% house edge, you're statistically expected to lose over time. Don't assume you can "beat" the game through skill or pattern recognition.</p>

            <h3>Mistake 6: Emotional Decision Making</h3>
            <p>Excitement after wins or frustration after losses can lead to poor decisions. Stay calm and stick to your predetermined approach.</p>

            <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

            <h3>How do I start playing Space XY?</h3>
            <p>Find Space XY at a licensed online casino offering BGaming games. Create an account, deposit funds, navigate to the game, and place your first bet during the betting phase.</p>

            <h3>What is the minimum bet in Space XY?</h3>
            <p>Minimum bets vary by casino but typically range from $0.10 to $1.00. Check your specific casino's limits.</p>

            <h3>Can I play Space XY for free?</h3>
            <p>Some casinos offer demo modes where you can play with virtual currency. This is great for learning the game without risk.</p>

            <h3>What happens if my internet disconnects?</h3>
            <p>If you have auto cash-out set, it will still activate if the target is reached. Without auto cash-out, your bet may run until the crash. Most casinos have policies for handling disconnections.</p>

            <h3>Can I cancel my bet after placing it?</h3>
            <p>Typically, you can cancel only during the betting phase before the round starts. Once the rocket launches, bets are locked.</p>

            <h3>Is there a strategy to win at Space XY?</h3>
            <p>No strategy can overcome the house edge. While various approaches exist (low multiplier targets, auto cash-out, etc.), none provide a mathematical advantage over the casino.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>Space XY is an engaging crash game with intuitive mechanics that are easy to learn. The basic concept - bet, watch, and cash out before the crash - is simple, but the game offers enough features (auto cash-out, multiple bets, unique X/Y display) to keep the experience interesting.</p>

            <p>As a beginner, focus on understanding the game mechanics, starting with small bets, and using features like auto cash-out to maintain discipline. Remember that Space XY has a built-in house edge, meaning the casino has a mathematical advantage over players in the long run.</p>

            <p>Most importantly, approach Space XY as entertainment rather than a way to make money. Set strict limits on time and money, never chase losses, and stop playing if it stops being fun.</p>
